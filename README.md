# quick-infogather
A python script combined with a little bit of batch to steal someone's data in Person pretty quickly

## Usage <br>
- Just double click on/run the quick-pcinfogather.exe. <br>
- When it's done it'll say that you are good to remove the usb. <br>
- At that time you can just unplug it, but obviously it doesn't need to be an usb. It could be anything capable of storing these type of files. <br>
- When it's done it'll automatically make a "dataoutput.txt" where all the data is stored. <br>
- I couldn't really find a way of formatting it prettily.
<br>
## Installation <br>
```
git clone https://https://github.com/eliahderechte/quick-infogather.git
cd quick-infogather.git
```
and run the .exe or the Python if you wish to. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: The .exe is only the converted Python script, but I wanted to put the Python in here aswell for improvement suggestions <br>
      It mostly works on Windows only but I'll try to give it a bigger compability.
